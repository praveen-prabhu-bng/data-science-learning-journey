    "Inheritance is a powerful feature in OOP that allows for code reuse and the creation of a more logical class structure. Single inheritance involves one base class, while multiple inheritance involves more than one base class. Understanding how to implement and use inheritance in Python will enable you to design more efficient and maintainable object-oriented programs."

It enables a single function to handle objects of different classes, each with its own implementation of a method.

    "\n",
    "Real World Applications \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Banking Applications\n",
    "- Example: Your bank account balance.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: The balance is private. You can’t directly change it; you must go through methods like deposit() or withdraw().\n",
    "- Why: Prevents unauthorized or accidental modification. Ensures rules (like minimum balance, overdraft protection) are enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mobile Apps (Messaging)\n",
    "- Example: WhatsApp message encryption.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: The encryption/decryption logic is hidden inside the app. Users only see “send” and “receive” functions.\n",
    "- Why: Protects sensitive data and prevents misuse of internal cryptographic keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Car Systems\n",
    "- Example: Car ignition system.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: You press a button or turn a key. Internally, complex processes (fuel injection, spark timing) are hidden.\n",
    "- Why: Drivers don’t need to know the mechanics; they just use the interface safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. E-Commerce Platforms\n",
    "- Example: Online shopping cart.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: The cart’s internal list of items is private. You interact through add_item(), remove_item(), checkout().\n",
    "- Why: Prevents direct tampering with cart data and ensures discounts, taxes, and inventory rules are applied correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Healthcare Systems\n",
    "- Example: Patient medical records.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Records are private. Doctors access them through secure portals with controlled methods (view, update).\n",
    "- Why: Protects privacy and ensures only authorized personnel can modify sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Gaming\n",
    "- Example: Player stats (health, score).\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Stats are private variables. They can only be changed through methods like take_damage() or add_score().\n",
    "- Why: Prevents cheating and keeps game logic consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Encapsulation Matters\n",
    "- Security: Protects sensitive data.\n",

    "1. File Handling\n",
    "- Reading large files line by line using iterators prevents memory overload.\n",
    "- Useful in log analysis, text mining, or ETL pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Streaming & Real-Time Data\n",
    "- Iterators handle continuous streams of data (e.g., sensor readings, API responses).\n",
    "- Example: Iterating over live stock market feeds or IoT sensor data without storing everything at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Database Query Results\n",
    "- Many database connectors return results as iterators.\n",
    "- You can fetch rows one at a time, which is memory-efficient for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Processing Pipelines\n",
    "- Iterators are the backbone of lazy evaluation in libraries like itertools and pandas.\n",
    "- Example: Chaining transformations (map, filter, zip) without creating intermediate lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Custom Iterators\n",
    "- You can design iterators for domain-specific tasks:\n",
    "- Iterating over pages in a PDF.\n",
    "- Iterating through frames in a video stream.\n",
    "- Iterating over batches in machine learning datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Generators & Infinite Sequences\n",
    "- Iterators power generators, which are used for:\n",
    "- Infinite sequences (e.g., Fibonacci numbers).\n",
    "- On-demand computation (e.g., simulation models).\n",
    "- Efficient looping in AI/ML training pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Considerations\n",
    "- Trade-off: Iterators are one-pass only; once consumed, you can’t rewind without recreating them.\n",
    "- StopIteration: Must be handled carefully in custom iterators.\n",
    "- Debugging: Lazy evaluation can make debugging harder since data isn’t materialized upfront."

    "##### Conclusion\n",
    "Iterators and generators are powerful tools in Python for creating and handling sequences of data efficiently. Iterators provide a way to access elements sequentially, while generators allow you to generate items on the fly, making them particularly useful for handling large datasets and infinite sequences. Understanding these concepts will enable you to write more efficient and memory-conscious Python programs."

    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "- Iterators are objects that implement __iter__() and __next__() methods explicitly.\n",
    "- Generators are a simpler way to create iterators using functions with yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "- Iterators require a class and manually defining iteration logic (__next__()).\n",
    "- Generators use yield, automatically handling iteration.\n",

    "Memory Usage:\n",
    "- Iterators may store the entire dataset in memory.\n",
    "- Generators produce values on demand, using less memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Flow:\n",
    "- Iterators start at the first value and continue calling next().\n",
    "- Generators pause execution at yield and resume when requested.\n",

    "State Retention:\n",
    "- Iterators require manual tracking of iteration state.\n",
    "- Generators automatically retain state between yield calls.\n",

    "Readability:\n",
    "- Iterators require more code and explicit handling.\n",
    "- Generators are more concise and easier to write.\n",

    "Performance:\n",
    "- Iterators can be memory-intensive for large datasets.\n",

They provide a clean and readable way to add functionality such as logging, timing, access control, and more without changing the original code. Understanding and using decorators effectively can significantly enhance your Python programming skills."
